description: I've wanted to do this for a couple of years...

In the past I've had blogs setup with a very unideal user experience. Not because I wanted to but because I never spent the time making it user friendly for myself. I think I was more focused on how cool the code was.

So I've taken the opposite approach this time and looked at what user experience I want out of my blog.

The requirements:
  - Must be a static site that can be hosted on [Netlify](netlify.com) so I can trigger automatic updates
  - Must use markdown: I find the formatting nice to use and it works well on mobile
  - Must work with the app [GitJournal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.gitjournal.gitjournal)

I found a Gatsby template which was minimal. I spent about 2 hours configuring it to work the way I needed it to for GitJournal. 

I'm glad I can post often and easily without the need for a computer or time.
