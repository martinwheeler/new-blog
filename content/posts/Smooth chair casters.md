I recently purchased some rollerblade wheels for my office chair and they are absolutely amazing. I was looking for something to prevent damage to the floor, as the usual chair casters can leave scratches and scuffs. I found the usual chair mats that you can purchase from Officeworks or the likes, but they look tacky.

The only problem I had was that my chair had screw in casters rather than the standard push in type. Thankfully we were throwing out an old chair and I could steal the wheel base from it.

So I dismantled the old chair, removed the old casters and installed the rollerblade wheels.

They are a much smoother ride and they don't leave any scratches or scuffs, it's also much easier to glide around the floor with less effort.

I will add that I have a hard floor so I'm not certain this would work well on a carpeted floor or rug.
