I recently purchased some rollerblade wheels for my office chair and they are absolutely amazing. 

The reason behind this is because I was looking for a way to prevent my chair from damaging the floor. As most would know, cheap chair casters don't roll smoothly and can start to drag along the floor. Most chair casters are made out of a very rough and hard plastic which can leave small scratches as you move around. I was going to buy a plastic chair mat but these look tacky and are a nuisance to deal with.

The only problem I had was that my chair had screw casters rather than the standard push-pull type. Thankfully we were throwing out an old chair and I could steal the wheel base from it, it had the correct type of casters which I could pull out.

So I dismantled the old chair, removed the old casters and installed the rollerblade wheels.

They are a so much smoother than the plastic ones and they don't leave any marks on the floor. It's also much easier to glide around the floor and with less effort.

I will add a note that I have a hard floor and I'm not certain they would work well on a carpet floor or rug.
