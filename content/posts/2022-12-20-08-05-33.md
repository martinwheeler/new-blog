I have had the strangest experience recently. It was a feeling that I couldn't relate to or had felt before. It was the feeling of an awkward silence.

Just a little bit of background about myself. When COVID 19 started I was unemployed, I put myself in this position, and I was about to begin an electrical apprenticeship. It dawned on me that I wasn't the most socialable person, I was a nerd. Before starting the electrical apprenticeship I had been working as a web programmer for 5 years. So going out into the world and away from my desk was quite daunting but I was also excited for the change. Sitting at a desk for long periods had started to get to me and I wanted to see the world and do something practical with my hands.

Ok back to the story. So my partner, Edda, and I were starting our journey as parents. We were having trouble naturally and we had to go down the IVF path. Being on an apprentices wage there was no way we were going to cover all the expenses, Edda was only working part time as well. We also wanted to do more travelling and have some more creature comforts around the home. So it was time for me to move back into the programming space. The money is great and there are plenty of opportunities around. In saying that, having the experience behind me made it much easier than if I hadn't had as much.

So I moved back to the programming space and found a role that was fully remote. This was something that was crucial to me as I wanted to be around to help with things as we were getting closer to the birth. I also wanted to WFH for when our son joined us in the world, it's great to be able to change a nappy or give him a cuddle when he isn't sleeping.

During my apprenticeship the gents were social and I managed to pick this up
