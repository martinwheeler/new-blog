The Model 3 comes with four exterior cameras, and one internal camera. These cameras are used for auto pilot, where the car can drive itself but they can acts as security too. Using the Tesla app you are able to remotely access these cameras and see what's going on around and inside the car, live, at any time of day.

The resolution of the cameras aren't the best but they will definitely give you a view of what's occuring.

When I watched the recorded version of the video it was much higher quality. So it appears the streamed quality is reduced, I'm assuming to keep the feed as near live as possible when on a bad mobile connection.

I thought for the longest time that the interior camera wasn't a camera until one of the latest updates where it become available to view in the app.
