We recently had an issue in our irrigation piping where it looked like someone had cut it with a shovel. There was a large cut and it was leaking water heavily. I only noticed it after hearing it as I was working nearby the leak.

The first line of defence was to install a cap right before the leak to prevent further water waste.

My next step was to purchase some rubber fitting that would slip over a replacement price of pipe. I thought this was going to solve the issue and I could call it a day.

The rubber fitting wasn't ideal though as the pressure in the pipes is roughly 3-4 bar. Everyone I would prime the pump it was burst at one of the rubber connections. I tried tightening the screws as much as humanly possible but still it would burst off.

The next step was to get some proper fittings which could withstand the pressure in the pipes. I went to a local irrigation store and purchase two fittings. One was a telescopic connector and the other was a static connector.

The telescopic connector is necessary in this situation as it's impossible to bend these pipes to connect them. The telescopic connector allows you to slide it up and down until you get a snug fit.

Once these connectors were installed I pressurised the system and there were no leaks.

We are now able to use or tap with full pressure and the pump doesn't run endlessly when no one is using the tap.
