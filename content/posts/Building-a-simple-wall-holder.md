So I'm going to attempt to build the "simpler wall organiser" that I found on Youtube by Chris Salomone.

The organiser will be used for myself and Edda's everyday & exercise related items:

- 2 yoga mats
- 2 yoga blocks
- 2 pairs of climbing shoes
- 2 chalk bags
- 2 mobile phones

With this in mind I also want to allow room for adding 2 key holders at some point in the near future.

I've recently acquired a table saw, which is pretty necessary from what I can tell in the video. I was also considering using a circular saw but my hand isn't very steady and I'm sure I wouldn't get a straight cut. I also think having a table saw is a great addition to my toolset.

The first thing I need to do is measure the items I want to put on the organiser and then begin designing it. I'll begin by drawing out all of the storage compartments, shelves and boxes based on the dimenions. This will help me decide how large the organiser should be.

Then I'll purchase the timber required based on my design.
