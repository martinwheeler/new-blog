# Certificate 2 in Electrotechnology Complete

I've finally finished the first step to becoming an electrician. The course went so quickly! Even though it was a 10-week course and seemed daunting, to begin with. Once we got to the halfway mark the rest of the course flew by, even though the second half was a lot harder. We were doing maths which I hadn't done since 2010. However, it came back to me fairly quickly once I had practised.

I'm glad it's finished and now I move onto an apprenticeship. I think in the current economic situation ill be hunting for a while. I did see that the government are looking at covering 50% of an apprentices wages until March 2021 so I should mention that to potential employers.
