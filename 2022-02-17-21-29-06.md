# Back to development

One journey ends and yet another begins. I'm back on the path to being a full-time developer. I think it's the smartest move for my current situation. I'm about to become a Dad and I want to be able to support the growth of my family financially. Being an electrical apprentice has been a great journey but it just doesn't offer anywhere near the same amount of income - and it's a 4-year journey, even for matured aged apprentices. I've definitely learnt a lot over my time as and apprentice and I will be taking with me some new skills. I'm eager to see how they will apply as I re-enter the dev world. I have real fascination with IoT so who knows... Maybe I'll pop up in that space.

I'm hoping to get back into the world of React development but any sort of Frontend role would be awesome. I'm actually quite excited to be able to work with a team of professionals and have an impact on a product again. The team environment is definitely something I enjoy and electrical work is usually in small teams of 2-3, so a bigger team is a welcomed change. I am also quite eager to learn some new tech knowledge and see how far I can push my understanding of the Frontend realm.

More to come as I apply for jobs...
